# BigBlue-Interactive Dashboard AIS-Maritime-Data
Repository for the 2nd project of an Interactive Dashboard during my studies in Big Blue Data Academy Data Science & Machine Learning Bootcamp 2023.
The objective of this project was to build an interactive dashboard using plotly and dash with Python.
Having a naval engineering background, I decided to create an interactive dashboard project to visualize AIS Maritime Data.

#### Dataset used: [AIS Maritime Data 🛳️](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aswinjose/ais-maritime-data)
AIS_UNACORN_Seatracks_past12-hours Dataset needs a lot of Data Cleaning & Preprocessing as observed in the notebook:
- Change unix timestamps to datetime
- Apply function to clean the data
- Create hour column for slider

#### EDA📊🕵🏻:
- Create a Map to visualize Vessels
- Create a Plot to observe the navigation status of the vessels
- Create a Plot to observe the type of the vessels
- Create an interactive dashboard using Dash
### Conclusion✅🏁:

  
All the insights that came from this dataset are listed in the Notebook.
