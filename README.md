# BigBlue-Interactive Dashboard AIS-Maritime-Data
Repository for the 2nd project of an Interactive Dashboard during my studies in Big Blue Data Academy Data Science & Machine Learning Bootcamp 2023.
The objective of this project was to build an interactive dashboard using plotly and dash with Python.
Having a naval engineering background, I decided to create an interactive dashboard project to visualize AIS Maritime Data.

#### Dataset used: [AIS Maritime Data 🛳️](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aswinjose/ais-maritime-data)
AIS_UNACORN_Seatracks_past12-hours Dataset needs a lot of Data Cleaning & Preprocessing as observed in the notebook:
- Change unix timestamps to datetime
- Apply function to clean the data
- Create hour column for slider

### EDA📊🕵🏻:
- Create a Map to visualize Vessels
- Create a Plot to observe the navigation status of the vessels
- Create a Plot to observe the type of the vessels
- Create an interactive dashboard using Dash
### Conclusion✅🏁:
The end-users of this dashboard could be port authorities, maritime traffic services, and shipping companies. Usage:
- Real-time Monitoring
- Security Surveillance, incident investigation
- User Friendly for more traditional personnel for collaboration and reporting
- Useful for data analysis with noon reports
